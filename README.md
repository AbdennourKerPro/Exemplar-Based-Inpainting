# Exemplar-Based Patch Inpainting

The implementation proposed is based on the method described in the following publication : *"Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Inpainting"* written by A. Criminisi, P. PÃ©rez and K. Toyama.

## Description
This project implements an inpainting method for reconstructing missing (or damaged) regions of an image using an **exemplar-based** approach. The main goal of this method is to fill in missing areas of an image by using "patches" that are similar to those found in the intact parts of the image. This technique is widely used in image processing, particularly for image restoration and object removal. The specificity of the method relies on the computation of a priority coefficient defining which pixels is treated first. This approach allows to reproduce very well contours and geometrical forms.

## Method
The **exemplar-based** inpainting method works in the following major steps:

1. **Patch Selection**: Square patches are extracted from the damaged region of the image. These patches are then compared with patches from the intact areas of the image.
2. **Patch Matching**: A corresponding patch is selected from the healthy region of the image. The matching is based on similarity criteria between patches.
3. **Insertion**: The most similar patch is inserted into the missing region, ensuring continuity in textures and borders of the image.
4. **Propagation**: This process is iterated over progressively larger areas of the image until the missing region is fully filled.

The process is optimized to minimize artifacts and maximize the quality of the final result by preserving the textures and structure of the original image.
